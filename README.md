# screeps
I am new to screeps but want to put my code in case it helps anyone else.

This code is as of level 4.  I have looked at others code and adopted it.  This is very much still a work in progress.  I have not yet written any code to advance and take over other rooms.

I just finished a basic defense system with a tower and also defense creeps will be created if a hostile creep enters my room.

There is still much automation yet to create, more than I even know of.
